# react-admin-dashboard-app
*README.md is a work in progress*
## About This Project
This project provides users with the ability to view important business metrics, manage users and customers, view recent transactions, and view several charts and an editable calendar for events. Designed to work on mobile devices, the dashboard is fully customizable and responsive. Light and dark themes can be toggled and theme colors can be changed. In addition to the dashboard, there are three pages, four apps, and seven fully functional charts in the project.

My goal with this project is to learn new skills with React for web development. During the development of this project, Tailwind CSS was used (https://tailwindcss.com/). In essence, Tailwind is a CSS framework designed for creating fast and custom user interfaces. The free online course can be found here: https://youtu.be/jx5hdo50a2M
